2. FISCAL DEVICE GATEWAY USAGE SCENARIOS 
2.1. Device registration 
The process starts when a taxpayer initially registers or updates their information using 
the Zimra registration portal. After completing this process, the taxpayer is provided with 
device ID and Activation Key. Device registration must be done once before starting to use a 
new device. After device registration, it needs to get its configurations (config) from FDMS. 
2.2. Fiscal device communication modes 
Fiscal device communicates with Fiscal Device Gateway API in one of two possible 
communication modes: 
 Online 
 Offline 
Online communication mode represents fiscal device communication in a way when 
fiscal device must have online access to FDMS (must have internet connection available) when 
it wants to close fiscal day. Fiscal day opening and submission of a receipt to FDMS should be 
done immediately after opening a day or printing receipt or invoice for buyer respectively, 
however in case of missing internet connection, day opening message and submission of a 
receipt may be delayed but must be done before closing a fiscal day. In case fiscal day was 
opened and receipt was issued without internet connection, it is mandatory, that fiscal day 
opening message would be sent before sending receipts. Otherwise, receipts will not be 
accepted. 
5 of 77 
Copyright © ZIMRA  
Offline communication mode represents fiscal device communication in a way, when 
fiscal device may not have internet, and its receipts and fiscal report data will be provided to 
FDMS by using files (by uploading file using Self-service, or by sending file to Fiscal Device 
Gateway API, whenever connection will be available). 
2.3. Fiscal day (in online mode) 
After successful device registration, it can be used for submitting sales to FDMS. Sales 
submission is possible only when fiscal day is opened. When work is finished with device, it 
must close fiscal day. 
In case of error in fiscal day report processing report must be corrected on device and 
resubmitted to FDMS. Report resubmission can be done unlimited number of times. In case it 
does not give successful result, and supplier cannot fix it to submit successful report, fiscal day 
may be closed manually by supplier in Public Portal, or by ZIMRA officer.

Copyright © ZIMRA  
2.4. Fiscal day (in offline mode) 
If device has internet connection, it should call getConfig method, to get device 
configuration information.  
Device opens fiscal day, if device has internet connection it can send information using 
submitFile method (file with only header) about opened day. 
Invoices are issued which are saved in device if device has internet connection it can 
send information using submitFile method (file with header and content) about already issued 
invoices. 
After fiscal day is closed information is saved in device, if device has internet connection 
it should send information using submitFile method (file with header and footer) about closed 
day. However, if there are still left unsent invoices it should send information using submitFile 
method (file with header, content and footer) about receipts and closed day. 
After sending file device should call getFileStatus method to get sent file status.

3. OBJECT STATUSES 
3.1. Fiscal day statuses 
Status 
Description 
1. FiscalDayClosed 
Status used when fiscal device has successfully closed fiscal day. New fiscal day opening is 
possible only from this status. 
2. FiscalDayOpened 
Fiscal day is opened. Invoices can be created only when fiscal day is in this status. 
3. FiscalDayCloseInitiated 
Closure of fiscal day is initiated, however FDMS not yet validated fiscal counters. 
While Fiscal day is in status “FiscalDayCloseInitiated”, no new request to initiate fiscal day 
closure will be accepted from device or user. New invoices will not be accepted as well. 
4. Is processing successful? 
If processing of report is successful, fiscal day status is changed to FiscalDayClosed, if 
processing of report is not successful status is changed to FiscalDayCloseFailed. 
5. FiscalDayCloseFailed 
FDMS validated fiscal day report received from device, however there are validation errors. 
Device must correct issues and repeatedly submit fiscal day closure message.

4. FISCAL DEVICE GATEWAY API INTERFACES 
Fiscal Device Gateway API exposes its methods using REST JSON interface. All methods 
except closeDay and submitFile are synchronous. closeDay and submitFile methods return 
response about accepted request synchronously, however processing of information is done 
asynchronously.

422 
Unprocessable Content – the instructions given by fiscal device to Fiscal Backend Gateway are incorrect, 
the response object ProblemDetails should contain ErrorCode to indicate the exact failing condition (e.g., 
DEV01 – device is blocked and therefore no instructions could be processed from such device) 
500 
Infrastructure error – the Fiscal Backend Gateway server is not available, or some infrastructure error 
occurred. The fiscal device should retry to send message later. 
502 
Bad gateway - the Fiscal Backend Gateway server could not be contacted. The fiscal device should retry to 
send message later. 
Error codes), in these cases: 
 fiscal device status is other than “Active”; 
 fiscal day status is other than “FiscalDayOpened” or “FiscalDayCloseFailed”; 
 receipt message structure is not valid. 
In case the above-mentioned validations have passed, but receipt has other validation 
issues specified below (described in “Validation rules”), receipt will be accepted and signed, 
but will be marked as invalid with validation color code assigned (as specified in 8.2.1. 
Validation errors).

 request structure is not valid; 
 device id in input parameters and file header are different; 
 file Header failed to be parsed; 
 file is sent for already closed day. 
In case the above-mentioned validations have passed, file is processed asynchronously.  
File status can be received by calling 4.10 getFileStatus API method. 
If other validation issues during asynchronous processing will be detected error 
information may be retrieved in 4.10 getFileStatus response. 
During asynchronous processing these steps will be executed: 
 file structure will be validated; 
 fiscal day status validated by information provided in header;

FISCAL COUNTERS 
With each submitted receipt (FiscalInvoice, CreditNote and DebitNote), fiscal counters 
are updated. 
After fiscal device finishes a fiscal day, it must close it by sending fiscal day report with 
fiscal counters provided in the table below to Fiscal Device Gateway API. Fiscal counter is 
optional to be sent in case it’s value is zero. 
Counters list and calculation rules for different types of receipt and different types of 
receipt lines are provided below. Please take a note to use correct sign when calculating a

fiscal counters become a negative sign too. 
Fiscal day counters are reset after fiscal day close. Starting from a new fiscal day, 
counters start to be counted from zero.

7. INTEGRATION SETUP REQUIREMENTS 
7.1. Communication and security protocols 
Fiscal Device Gateway API can be accessed using HTTPS protocol only. All Fiscal Device 
Gateway API methods except registerDevice and getServerCertificate use client authentication 
certificate which is issued by FDMS. 
7.2. Environment addresses 
Fiscal Device Gateway API is accessible in testing and production (real) environments. 
URL to access API: 
Environment 
URL 
Testing environment 
https://fdmsapitest.zimra.co.zw 
Testing environment’s API can also be accessed using Swagger on 
https://fdmsapitest.zimra.co.zw/swagger/index.html 
Production environment 
https://fdmsapi.zimra.co.zw 
7.3. Authentication and authorization 
Fiscal 
Device 
Gateway 
uses 
mutual 
TLS authentication 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) to authenticate fiscal device using 
fiscal device certificate. Fiscal device certificate is validated against issuing certificate to allow 
or deny access to API endpoints. 
Note: endpoints 4.1 verifyTaxpayerInformation, 4.2 registerDevice, 4.12 getServerCertificate 
are public and do not require authentication. After authentication, provided fiscal device 
certificate is checked against issued certificate (see 4.2 registerDevice and 4.3 issueCertificate 
and methods for fiscal device certificate issuing) to check if the fiscal device certificate was 
issued to calling device (by method parameter deviceId) and the fiscal device certificate was 
not revoked. 
The Fiscal Device Gateway will return HTTP 401 unauthorized code if: 
 The provided fiscal device certificate was issued not by Fiscal Device 
Gateway. 
 The provided fiscal device certificate was revoked. 
 The provided fiscal device certificate expired. 
 The provided fiscal device certificate was not issued to calling fiscal 
device. 
7.4. Timeout Settings 
Fiscal Device Gateway API response timeout for any synchronous operation – 30 seconds.

8. ERRORS 
In case of API error, the system will return 4xx or 5xx http error code with response 
body containing a detailed problem details structure as described in https://www.rfc
editor.org/rfc/rfc7807 . 
ProblemDetails: 
Name Type Mandatory Description 
type String Yes  
title String Yes human readable problem definition 
status Integer Yes Http status code 
errorCode String No specific error code, for exact meaning see below 
 
8.1. Http statuses 
API can return such http statuses for errors: 
Http status Description 
400 bad request – the message is malformed and could not be processed by Fiscal Backend Gateway 
401 Authentication error (see Authentication and authorization) 
404 Resource not found (call to not existing endpoint) 
405 method not allowed – trying to access API using unsupported HTTP methos, e.g., POST to get config 
422 Unprocessable Content – the instructions given by fiscal device to Fiscal Backend Gateway are incorrect, 
the response object ProblemDetails should contain ErrorCode to indicate the exact failing condition (e.g., 
DEV01 – device is blocked and therefore no instructions could be processed from such device) 
500 Infrastructure error – the Fiscal Backend Gateway server is not available, or some infrastructure error 
occurred. The fiscal device should retry to send message later. 
502 Bad gateway - the Fiscal Backend Gateway server could not be contacted. The fiscal device should retry to 
send message later.

8.2.1. Validation errors 
When sumbitReceipt request is received by FDMS and it is not rejected, FDMS validates 
receipt data. In case previous receipt is missing, validation rules which require previous receipt 
to be present are temporarily marked as grey and are revalidated when previous receipt is 
received. After a validation, receipt is stored and signed by FDMS. Receipt validation status 
may be valid or invalid. In case of invalid receipt, validation errors are categorized by one of 
these colors: 
 
Color Description 
Grey This means that received receipt violates receipt chain and makes a gap in receipt chain (previous receipt is 
missing). Such receipt is marked in “Grey”. With each of the next received receipt, such “Grey” receipt will 
be revalidated (in case newly received receipt is the previous for the “Grey” receipt). After repeated 
validation it will remain “Grey” (if newly received receipt is not the previous for it) or become valid. 
 
 
 
 
 
Copyright © ZIMRA  45 of 77 
 
Fiscal day will not be allowed to be closed automatically if it has at least one “Grey” receipt.  
Yellow “Yellow” validation errors are minor ones. Fiscal day will be allowed to be closed automatically if it 
contains only “Yellow” validation errors. 
Red “Red” validation errors are major ones. Fiscal day fill is not allowed to be closed automatically if it has at 
least one “Red” receipt. 
 
Possible validation errors and their color codes:

9. REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL DEVICES 
This chapter specifies requirements for fiscal devices to be met: 
1. Fiscal device must open a new fiscal day before issuing receipts and 
invoices. 
2. Fiscal device if internet connection is available must retrieve 
configuration from FDMS (getConfig endpoint) before opening a new fiscal 
day. 
3. Fiscal device must save data from getConfig response about taxpayer 
and/or its branch (taxpayer name, address, contacts, etc.) and use it for 
receipt and invoice printing. 
4. Fiscal device must track the time passed from opening a fiscal day, that 
it would not exceed maximum allowed fiscal day length (specified in 
parameter taxPayerDayMaxHrs) and forbid issuing new receipts and 
invoices after that.  
5. Fiscal device must inform user about the approaching fiscal day end. 
Notification must be shown to the user a few hours before maximum fiscal 
day length is reached. The exact number of hours left to maximum fiscal 
day length is specified in parameter taxpayerDayEndNotificationHrs. 
6. Fiscal device must assign receiptGlobalNo value to a receipt in a 
sequential order starting from 1 and continue numbering despite fiscal 
day close.  
7. In case receiptGlobalNo value becomes very big and taxpayer would like 
to reset it, this can be done by submitting the first receipt in a new fiscal 
day. 
8. Fiscal device must assign receiptCounter value to a receipt in a sequential 
order starting from 1 and continue numbering only in the same fiscal day. 
After fiscal day closure, receiptCounter must be reset to 0. 
9. Fiscal device must not allow to add goods or services with VAT tax to 
receipt or invoice if taxpayer is not a VAT taxpayer (VATNumber value is 
received in getConfig response). In case taxpayer gets VAT number in the 
middle of fiscal day, fiscal device must not allow to issue new receipts or 
invoices and must require closing fiscal day first. 
10. Fiscal day opening message must be sent immediately after opening a 
fiscal day, however if there is no connection, it can be delayed. 
11. Receipt must be sent to Fiscal Device Gateway API only after successfully 
opening a fiscal day. 
12. Fiscal device must send receipt to Fiscal Device Gateway API only after 
finishing it (when receipt is printed). 
13. Fiscal device must send receipt to Fiscal Device Gateway API one by one 
in ascending receiptGlobalNo order, not skipping any of receipt. In case 
submission of receipt failed, issue must be fixed, and receipt submission 
must be repeated. 
47 of 77 
Copyright © ZIMRA  
14. Fiscal device must send receipt to Fiscal Device Gateway API immediately 
after finishing it in case there is an internet connection and there are no 
waiting receipts to be sent, otherwise receipt must be put to the queue 
on device and send later when connection will be restored. 
15. Fiscal device must update counters after issuing a receipt and reset 
counters after starting a new fiscal day as specified in 6. Fiscal counters. 
16. Fiscal device must renew certificate which is near to expire before its 
expiration date. 
17. Offline Fiscal device must send file content only for a single closed fiscal 
day. File cannot contain invoices from more than one fiscal day. 
18. If file is bigger than 3 MB, content should be split into separate files, 
footer can’t be split to two or more separate parts. 
19. If fiscal day has a lot of receipts, it is recommended to split receipts and 
Z report to separate files. 
20. If offline fiscal device prepared more than one file for a single fiscal day, 
these files must be sent to FDMS one by one in sequential order. 
21. Offline fiscal devices must be able to export file with invoices if user 
requests it for manual upload to FDMS Self-service. 
22. User must not uninstall application from device if there are unsent

13.SIGNATURES GENERATION AND VERIFICATION RULES 
13.1. Signature an hash generation algorithm 
Below algorithm is used to generate receipt and fiscal day hash and signature: 
1) Receipt or fiscal day fields must be converted to string (by rules as described in table 
below) and concatenated (no concatenation character is used); 
2) Concatenated line must be hashed using SHA256 to get the hash; 
3) Concatenated line must be signed with private key to get the signature. 
Formula to get a hash: Hash = SHA-256(x1|| x2||…||xn); 
Formula to get a signature: 
Signature = RSA(x1|| x2||…||xn,d,n) – in case RSA keys are used 
or 
Signature = ECC(Hash,CURVE,g,n) – in case ECC keys are used 
Where 
|| - means field concatenation; 
x1, x2, …, xn  - receipt or fiscal day fields; 
d – secret RSA exponent; 
n - RSA modulus 
CURVE – the elliptic curve field and equation used 
G – elliptic curve base point, a point on the curve that generates a subgroup of large 
prime order n 
n – integer order of G, means that n x G=O, where O is the identity element. 
13.2. Receipt signature generation and verification 
Receipt hash and signature are generated according to the rules provided in section 
13.1. 
13.2.1. Receipt device signature 
Fields included in receipt hash which is used for device signature are (these fields must 
be included in hash in the same order as provided below): 
Order 
Field name 
Description 
1 
deviceID 
Device ID 
2 
receiptType 
Receipt type value in upper case. 
3 
receiptCurrency 
Currency code (ISO 4217 currency code). It must be in upper case. 
4 
receiptGlobalNo 
Receipt global number. 
5 
receiptDate 
Date in ISO 8601 format <date>T<time>, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss (hours are 
represented in 24 hours format, local time). 
Example: 2019-09-23T14:43:23 
6 
receiptTotal 
Receipt total is included in signature in cents. 
Examples: - If receiptTotal is 500 ZWL, value 50000 must be used in signature. - If receiptTotal is 12,34 USD, value 1234 must be used in signature. - If receiptTotal is 0,05 USD, value 5 must be used in signature. 
7 
receiptTaxes 
Concatenated receiptTaxes, where each line is concatenated in this way: 
taxCode || taxPercent || taxAmount || salesAmountWithTax. 
In case of taxPercent is not sent, empty value should be used in signature. 
Amounts are represented in cents. In case taxPercent is not an integer 
there should be dot between the integer and fractional part. In case of 
exempt which does not send tax percent value, empty value should be used 
in signature.

Copyright © ZIMRA  73 of 77 
 
In case taxPercent is an integer there should be value of tax percent, dot 
and two zeros sent. 
Taxes are ordered by taxID in ascending order and taxCode in alphabetical 
order (if taxCode is empty it is ordered before A letter). 
Examples: - If taxPercent is 15, value 15.00 must be used in signature. - If taxPercent is 14.5 value 14.50 must be used in signature. - If taxPercent is 0 value 0.00 must be used in signature. 
8 previousReceiptHash Previous receipt hash is included into current receipt device signature. This 
will create a chain of receipts. 
This field is not used in signature when current receipt is first in fiscal day.

3 fiscalDayDate Fiscal day date (date when fiscal day was opened). 
Date in ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DD. 
Example: 2019-09-23 
4 fiscalDayCounters Concatenated fiscal day counter lines, where each line is concatenated in this 
way: fiscalCounterType || fiscalCounterCurrency || fiscalCounterTaxPercent or 
fiscalCounterMoneyType || fiscalCounterValue. 
 
All text values are concatenated in upper case. 
Amounts are represented in cents. 
Only non-zero value fiscal counters are included in concatenation. 
Fiscal counters are concatenated in this order: 
 fiscalCounterType (in ascending order) 
 fiscalCounterCurrency (in alphabetical ascending order) 
 fiscalCounterTaxID (in ascending order) / fiscalCounterMoneyType (in 
ascending order) 
In case taxPercent is not an integer there should be dot between the integer and 
fractional part. In case of exempt which does not send tax percent value, empty 
value should be used in signature. In case taxPercent is an integer there should be 
value of tax percent, dot and two zeros sent. 
Examples: - If taxPercent is 15, value 15.00 must be used in signature. - If taxPercent is 14.5 value 14.50 must be used in signature. - If taxPercent is 0 value 0.00 must be used in signature.
