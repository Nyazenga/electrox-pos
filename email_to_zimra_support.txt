Subject: Test Device Reset Request & Technical Clarifications - Device IDs 30199, 30200

Dear ZIMRA Technical Support,

I am one of the developers working on our fiscal device integration. This is my first time implementing this integration, and I was not the original contact person for this project (this email is forwarded for reference).

We require assistance with our test device integration:

1. DEVICE RESET REQUEST
   Please reset device registrations for:
   - Device ID: 30199 (Serial: electrox-1) - Certificate lost during development
   - Device ID: 30200 (Serial: electrox-2) - Need clean state for testing
   
   Reason: Development issues with receipt persistence and certificate loss require a fresh start.

2. TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS

   a) RCPT020 Error (USD Currency):
      Receiving "Invoice signature is not valid" errors for USD receipts only; ZWL receipts work correctly. 
      Question: Are there currency-specific signature requirements, or should the format be identical?
      
      DOCUMENTATION ERROR IDENTIFIED:
      In Section 13.2.1, "Example No 2" (USD currency), the "Result used for hash generation" appears to be 
      missing the required fields at the beginning. It shows:
      "07000.000100014.50535 hNVJXP/ACOiE8McD3pKsDlqBXpuaUqQOfPnMyfZWI9k="
      
      However, based on "Example No 1" (ZWL), it should include:
      deviceID || receiptType || receiptCurrency || receiptGlobalNo || receiptDate || receiptTotal || receiptTaxes || previousReceiptHash
      
      Should Example No 2's hash generation string start with "322FISCALINVOICEUSD852019-09-19T09:23:074035" 
      (deviceID=322, receiptTotal=4035 cents) before the receiptTaxes result?
      
      Also, there is no example provided for the first receipt in a fiscal day (when previousReceiptHash 
      is not present). Could you provide clarification on how to handle this case?
      
      (Section 13.2 - Receipt signature generation and verification is attached for reference, with 
      the problematic example highlighted)

   b) Fiscal Day Signature Format:
      Documentation v7.2 Section 13.3.1 example shows: "BALANCEBYMONEYTYPEUSDLCASH3700"
      Question: Is the "L" between "USD" and "CASH" (USDLCASH) intentional, or a documentation typo?
      Should it be "BALANCEBYMONEYTYPEUSDCASH3700" instead?
      (Relevant documentation sections are attached for reference)

   c) Documentation:
      Currently using v7.2. Is a newer version available with updated examples?
      If there are any errors or mistakes in the documentation, clarity would be greatly appreciated.

3. REQUESTED ACTIONS
   - Reset devices 30199 and 30200
   - Provide correct activation keys (if changed)
   - Clarify fiscal day signature format (the "L" in example)
   - Confirm currency-specific signature requirements
   - Correct/clarify Example No 2 in Section 13.2.1 (missing fields in hash generation string)
   - Provide example for first receipt in fiscal day (when previousReceiptHash is absent)
   - Share latest documentation version

I have attached the relevant sections of the documentation (Section 13.2 - Receipt signature generation and verification, and Section 13.3.1 - Fiscal day signature generation) that require clarification for your reference.

Thank you for your assistance.
